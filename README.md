# LendingClub Case Study
> Lending Club extends loans to individuals, but a significant number of these borrowers fail to repay the borrowed amount along with the accrued interest, leading to defaults. These defaults result in financial losses for the lenders or businesses involved. Consequently, this case study aims to uncover key factors that can help predict which borrowers are more likely to default. By analyzing the available data, we have identified and reported several critical factors that contribute to a higher probability of default. Understanding these factors can aid in better risk assessment and decision-making for lenders, ultimately minimizing potential financial losses.

## General Information
*Lending Club offers loans to borrowers, but many borrowers default, meaning they fail to repay the borrowed amount along with the accrued interest to the lenders.

*These defaults lead to financial losses for businesses or lenders.

*Therefore, the aim of this case study is to identify key factors that can help in understanding which borrowers are more likely to default.

*In this project, several factors have been analyzed and identified from the data, and the findings have been reported.

## Conclusions
•	Small businesses have a higher charge-off rate, constituting 28% of charge-offs indicates that lower income individuals are likely to default.
•	Either sub-grades or loan grades decrease, the charge-off rate increases proportionately.
•	An increased number of bankruptcies correlates with higher charge-off rates.
•	Most borrowers chose a 36-month tenure period and requested amounts such as 5,000 or 10,000 .
•	Among the 129 individuals whose loans were not approved, most had previously paid off their loans, suggesting they could be reliable borrowers and reduce business losses if approved.
•	The default rate is higher for 60-month term loans, with about 25% charge-offs, compared to just 11% for 36-month terms, suggesting that longer-term loans might be riskier.
•	Interest rates for charged-off loans were higher than those for fully paid loans, indicating that higher interest rates may lead to more charge-offs.
•	Borrowers with higher installment amounts are more likely to charge off, as observed from the median and third quartile data.
